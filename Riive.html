        <p>Riive is a shareparking network that connects hosts with open driveway or parking space with riders looking for a place to park. Think of it as AirBnB for parking.</p>
        <p>As founder and lead developer, there were several business hoops I had to jump through before I could get to where I am today.  For the sake of 
          this portfolio, I'll be leaving out any business information.  For more information, please contact <a style="text-decoration: underline; color:#FF8708;" href="mailto:support@riive.net">support@riive.net</a>
           for any business inquiries. We are a registered C-Corp in Delaware.
        </p>
        <p>Riive is currently in development. Not all deliverables are able to be shown unless upon request.</p>

        <p>Like many other share-economy apps out there, Riive is a multi-user market that has both hosts and riders.  This concept 
          is nothing new since the early beginnings of AirBnb, Uber and even earlier examples like Yelp or social media platforms. 
          A common roadblock these companies face is the userbase relies on others.  Early adopters make these platforms unique 
          and memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to start in a small or medium metropolitan area with marketing efforts that are not scalable to build a community. 
          Early in the process I sat down with potential riders and also homeowners in prime areas. I conducted a research plan to 
          better understand their mental model of what I am working on, and to see how open people are to something foreign.
        </p>
        <p>
            This research led me to believe that there is a definite market for an ambitious project like this, and I went in 
            to dig deeper into designing and developing the best experience for both the rider and the host.

          <h3 style="color: #aaaaaa" class="subHead">"How might we become more adventurous?"</h3>
          <p>This was the question I asked myself over and over. Why don't we explore more? Surprisingly enough, 
            I found a significant amount of people found that expense or the fear of unknown travel plans 
            cause people to be hesitant about breaking out of their shell. Whether it be a new city halfway 
            around the world, or a hip area of your hometown, I wanted to tackle this problem head on.
          </p>
          <p>I tested a paper prototype after conceptualizing the idea, and people felt surprisingly comfortable 
            sharing their space or parking in someone's driveway they don't know. One response resonated with me. 
            "If people feel comfortable sharing something as intimate as their home, I don't see why I would 
            mind leasing out my driveway space."  I think this person's statement truly inspired me, and 
            I certainly have the AirBnB's and Uber's to thank for breaking into this comfort zone.

            <p style="color: white;">When designing the early stages of the high fidelity prototype, 
              I knew I was going to have to standardize color and typography. Luckily from my experience 
              with Orchid Design System, I not only understood the best color theory techniques, but 
              I also had a firm grasp on the WCAG color compliance guidelines.  Orange is a notably difficult 
              color to work with, but I knew I wanted this color since it was unique in app design and also 
              heavily linked to people's idea of transportation.

              <p>Once I had felt the design was in a place to test, I put together another study. This study was 
                more focused on usability than ideation or validation of adoption. The test included 5 people and 
                a majority of people were recruited in a local subreddit of all places (thanks to everyone 
                at r/Pittsburgh for your help). Together, I put my designs in front of users and observed while taking 
                notes.
              </p>
              <p>The study was focused more on the rider experience and placed them in key scenarios that they may 
                cross at any given moment in the app. From messaging a host to selecting a payment method, test 
                users walked through the process from searching for a spot to the point of arrival. The overall 
                concensus was positive, with minor fixes to make some actions more explicit in the UI.

                  <p>Around this time, I began thinking through my development stack I will need to adopt for this project. I am well versed 
                    in front-end development as well as various frameworks, but I knew I wanted to include React Native since I have experience developing 
                    web apps in React JS. But this only solved half the problem, I still needed data management via a server. To improve future 
                    scalability, I built the back end authentication and server on Firebase. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To remain PCI compliant, here was one final part of the puzzle that needed to be solved: payments. Due to the great documentation and React Native support,
                    I decided to use Stripe as my payment vendor. This allows users to use most credit cards, Apple Pay or Google Wallet. Future support 
                    for other payment methods can also be easily added. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      While currently still in development, great progress has been made to ensure that users' data is secure.
