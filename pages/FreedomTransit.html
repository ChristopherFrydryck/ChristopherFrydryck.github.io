    <blockquote>The biggest problem users face is if their bus is early or late, they will never know until they catch the next bus and arrive late to their 
        destination.</blockquote>
    <span>
        <p>Freedom Transit approached myself and two of my peers to design and develop a live bus tracker for our senior capstone project. We had under three months to 
          design, test and develop both a web app and a native Android app and ship it out. Long nights and 23 highly caffenated espressos later, we had a final
          capstone completed and spent none of our $10,000 budget.
        </p>
        <p>Going into the project, we were graciously handed a 30+ page packet of their recent research they conducted on their current riders. From demographic
          information to route rider count, we were very pleased to have this data that was recently conducted one month prior to our involvement.

        <h3 style="color: #d47c18;" class="subHead">Even though we had a large packet of research, that wasn't enough...</h3>
        <p>It isn't uncommon to stumble upon a multiple user market. Sure, there is a primary user in mind, but others also take up a portion 
          of the usership. One key demographic was international students, however our primary focus was their loyal riders.
        </p>
        <p>Freedom Transit is the top transit authority in Washington, PA. It is no surpsie that apart from nine-to-five workers, students 
          without vehicles are the next largest demographic, since Washington & Jefferson College is at the epicenter of the city.  With limited 
          college shuttles and foreign students staying on campus during holiday break, their best escape is taking the shuttle to the downtown Pittsburgh
          area.

        <div class="text">
          <h3 style="color: #aaaaaa" class="subHead">Imagine Queueing Theory, but like, forever...</h3>
          <p>Picture this: you are going through your morning routine. You think to yourself, wake up, shower, change, eat breakfast and get out the door. 
            But once you get up and get in the shower, your water doesn't turn on, and you can't leave your shower until the water turns back on.  That 
            is the frustration their riders are facing daily. They have a routine they like to go through only to have something entirely out of 
            their control mess up their entire routine. 
          </p>
          <p>We are creatures of habit. We like to eat the same breakfast, get out the door by a certain time and walk that same path to work each day. 
            When something impedes our ability to perform our daily practices, we get frustrated. Sadly, the answer to this isn't "become more flexible." 
            Instead, we should ask ourselves "how might we make people's daily variables more predictable?" We knew now what our problem was.  
          </p>
          <p>From here, we devised a mental model of how we might do this. We would need two apps. One web app that is user facing, and one native app on 
            the tablets on the busses that pings its GPS coordinates every three to five seconds.  Then, our web app would gather this data and display it 
            in the UI.

            <p style="color: white;">All kidding aside, we had brainstormed, researched live trackers, devised a mental model and wanted to create a lo-fi 
              paper prototype.  We designed it knowing our constraints and user's low tech savvyness. </p>
              <p style="color: white;">After synthesizing our findings and clustering them, we found where our opportunities are and we aligned it with our 
              skillset. I focused heavily on the design (HTML & CSS) as well as programming the tablets in Java, while my teammate put together the logic 
              of the bus routes using Firebase, Google Maps and GIS data we had collected on the bus routes.

              <p>At this point, my fellow teammate and I got to business with the final product. I first took the results from 
                our paper prototyping session and constructed a rough design in Adobe XD. The overall goal of this was to help 
                align my design with my code. While the designs I put together were not pretty, we had to ensure that it 
                had large touch targets for older users, met the current design of Freedom Transit's website and was 
                able to be completed in a few weeks.
              </p>
              <p>While I began the design session and also the Java app that ran on the bus tablets, my teammate began hooking
                up the web app to Firebase and setting up Google Maps API to showcase the routes using GIS data we had collected
                for Freedom Transit.  This task was daunting for the two of us, but we found that coffee and
                fresh air did the trick to keep us sane.

                  <p>Before we delivered the final product, we knew we had one final step: documentation. We know, this isn't the most exciting work,
                    but it is important nonetheless. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Together we crafted several documents including a budget breakdown, installation guide for new tablets, adding a new route guide 
                    and other artifacts along the way from our risk analysis to early designs. Handing off the project smoothly is something 
                    even large design and development firms have issues with. We wanted to ensure that when we graduated, their lead developer 
                    could take over without needing to call us at a moment's notice. You can view our entire project report <a style="color: #d47c18;; text-decoration: underline;" href="artifacts/Freedom_ProjectReport.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>After our final presentation in front of a panel of professors at the college, we were excited to hear we 
                      passed with flying colors. Afterwards we had a short retrospective on our journey and how much we accomplished 
                      in such a short time.

                    <p>I'm very glad to have taken on the most technical capstone project offered during my final semester at Washington 
                      & Jefferson College. It truly paid off in the end because it further reassured that I love both UX and coding, 
                      and I should use both of those skills to continue making stuff of my own. But for now, here is a quick demo video of our 
                      final product:
