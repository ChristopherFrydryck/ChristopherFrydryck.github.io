        <p>UPMC Provider Search is a search tool for UPMC’s millions of members. With over 50,000 unique visitors monthly and over 3,000,000 
          unique visitors as of March 2020, We know that our members need to discover new doctors, nurse practitioners and health providers alike.  
          I was brought on the project with a fellow UX designer on the team to address usability issues and improve our users to become more 
          powerful in their search.</p>

        <p>We have a wide variety of users.  Expectedly, we see members of all different backgrounds (commercial members, Medicare, Medicaid, SNP, 
          CHIP, etc.), but we also see our own customer support team reference our public directory when people call not knowing where to look for 
          a provider. Finally, even providers and doctors will reference our data to ensure it is up to date with new locations, contact info and 
          much more.  While there are many different types of users, we know our largest group is our health insurance members, but our true power 
          users are our customer service representatives.  This was a problem since every call we receive from members on this topic cost UPMC money.</p>

          <h3 style="color: #aaaaaa" class="subHead">No product is perfect, but we had some serious usability issues.</h3>
          <p>Since every call will cost UPMC time and money, we wanted to improve our interface to better improve our search functionality and bring a 
            friendlier approach to searching.  A few problems upon researching with users and analyzing our analytics on the site included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our header and footer bury the important content that users care about</li>
            <li>Empty results lacked empathy and feedback to help a user</li>
            <li>Only 3% of users applied even a single filter to their search</li>
            <li>Warning and error messaging was not clear and eventually left users calling our customer support for clarification</li>
            <li>The page interaction was confusing to older members and two scrollbars was jarring</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Upon assessing all these problems, we knew that tackling all of them at once would be difficult, and had gone back to the drawing board to 
            assess all of our problems within one “how might we” statement to have an ultimate goal to reach.</p>

            <p style="color: white;">The problems our users are facing are mostly interaction problems, and the outcomes are not what they expected.  
              What we did was then sat down with power users, our customer service representatives, to see how they work and where most users calling in fail.  
              All our problems we outlined were true (and even more so than we expected). This brought us back together with the business leadership to come 
              up with an overarching problem statement of: “How might we construct a predictable search experience that caters information to users’ needs?”  
              Along with this, we tied a few metrics to our success including: system usability score (SUS), net promoter score (NPS) and percentage of users filtering results.</p>

                Because I joined this product with a fellow UX designer that was already focused 100% on the product, 
                I needed to familiarize myself and the rest of the team with key moments in a member journey, and where we 
                can ultimately aim for in the next few sprints.  I mapped each user’s experience based on many different 
                starting places and hosted several brainstorming sessions with the product owner, project manager and the 
                other designer to validate where we can solve the problems I stated earlier.

                  <p>Upon coming to the conclusion of the places we need to improve the product in the user flow, I began diving deep into ideation 
                    of certain problems including our content in the card, the scroll interface, the filter ability, error messages and empty state.  
                    Individually attacking each usability problem, we pushed an A/B test virtually and got back results from users during certain tasks 
                    performed.  Many showed an improvement, but my favorite results were polarizing results that varied across the board. It was an 
                    invitation to pivot our thoughts in that part of the design and recreate new designs.

                    <p>However, we also know not every search result returns a result.  However, different users have different options to take based 
                      on their medical plan status. For instance Medicaid members may not have the same resources as commercial members, and we needed 
                      to design each of these pages to ensure we were correct in our design handoffs for engineers. While not the most important step, 
                      we wanted to ensure the handoff was as streamlined as possible for engineers.

                        every project I am on, this product was seeing massive changes that were all validated by users and need to be as close as possible to 
                        the prototypes we tested with users.</p>

                      <p>While we had accomplished shipping a product that was better tested and met the metrics we set early on, there were a few notes we left the 
                        product owner for the upcoming work to be done on the product. Our SUS score increased from a D score of 56 when I joined to a B score of 75 
                        upon finishing these updates.  We also saw NPS increase from 32% to 52% and filter usage increase from 3% to 24%. Upon viewing these results, 
                        we knew that we still had room to improve, but found success in our member market by empowering them with a better experience. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, we also knew there were some additional product design tasks to tackle next. First, there was more research needed to be done on language.  
                        We want to use words that are easily understood, but also understand that insurance is a confusing and regulated industry.  We also worked on other 
                        features in the results cards that we currently did not have in our dataset we gathered everything from. With these in mind, we began the next 
                        journey attacking these hard pressed topics.
