        <p>Gloo Design System is an unnamed project at Gloo to help drive context and consistency 
          across all of our products.  Building a design system is a very deliberate process that I 
          have had experience in the past with <a href="/pages/OrchidDS.html" style="color:#41B768" target="_blank">Orchid</a>, and took a deeper leadership role in the 
          decision making process that was to build Gloo Design System.  As of late September 2020, 
          the project has been on hold during a corporate restructure, and should resume in the near future.

          <h3 style="color: #aaaaaa" class="subHead">Designing for 8+ products is rough!</h3>
          <p>Contrary to what my portfolio may show, I don’t believe every company needs a design system. In fact it has 
            somewhat lost the grandeur of a design system once companies that are notoriously not design forward began 
            appropriating the word as a way to build a component library.  However, at Gloo this was not the case.
          </p>
          <p>At Gloo, there was approximately 8+ products upon joining the team, and the only central alignment of components, 
            primitives and other design decisions were all hosted in a style sheet that was well organized, but lacked anything 
            outside of being a central host of design decisions that may or may not have had reasoning behind the assets provided 
            to designers.  Designers ultimately pulled designs from other products and eventually each product became a patchwork 
            of other products with a lack of UX research behind the design of each component.
          </p>
          <p>I was hired by leadership to bring to the design team a well organized design system that carries over to the engineering 
            team as a tool that will eventually be public facing for third-party designers and engineers.</p>

            <p style="color: white;">I worked closely with leadership to take on some early project management and lead our efforts in 
              the right direction. This began with identifying who will be involved, if they are internal or external to the project, 
              how critical they are to the early process and what role they will play.  This process helped us streamline meetings and 
              know who needs to be involved where in the process.</p>

              <p>
                In the design ops space, designs for your fellow co-designers and engineers is really engaging, fun and easy to get 
                feedback.  We want to create an experience and product that empowers our designers to focus on deeper problems than 
                “what color should I use” and help improve the speed and consistency of our code with the help of Gloo’s engineers.
              </p>
              <p>We broke our users down to four groups with five disciplines. All of these can be interchangeable as both a group 
                and discipline. Our groups were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Leader</strong>: someone who steers the design system in the right direction</li>
                  <li><strong>System team</strong>: builders of our design system</li>
                  <li><strong>Contributor</strong>: outside of the design team, but contributors to the system</li>
                  <li><strong>Adopter</strong>: a direct consumer of the design system
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>On top of this, we also feature disciplines inside of these groups, where someone’s traditional role takes place. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Engineer</li>
                  <li>Designer</li>
                  <li>Content Writer</li>
                  <li>Researcher</li>
                  <li>QA</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these roles can play hand-in-hand with our groups. For instance, you can have an engineer that is a member of the system team, 
                  a designer that is an adopter and a content writer that is a contributor. All of these users have different motives to using the design 
                  system, and some may be more involved in our decision making than others, but it is important to understand the “who” just as much as 
                  the “why” in this case.</p>

                  <p>Now came the (not so) fun part.  In order to know what we need to accomplish an expansive design system, we need to know what 
                    products are using.  In this case, I performed an audit through our abstract libraries of each product and got the team engaged on 
                    joining to help catalog all our components and their usage throughout our platform. The process took approximately a week, and together 
                    helped identify not only our commonly used components, but also what gaps we are facing for certain use cases.

                    <p>Upon better understanding our users, I held a design thinking session with some users with an importance/difficulty matrix. Designers 
                      helped define the importance of each component, and engineers collaboratively decided the difficulty to build each component from an existing 
                      library of Material UI for React.  Once coming to a conclusion of each component, I met with the leader group to help vote for certain 
                      components which should be increased or decreased in priority, and helped guide our next task.

                      <p style="color: white;">Based on prior experience with Orchid, we tested many ways to improve the process of synchronizing design and engineering
                         to one cohesive process. While it can’t be certain that every component will take similar amounts of time, we can do our best to assign timelines 
                         to each step. This process took multiple iterations of our proof of concept testing, but finally we reached a place that was proven to work well 
                         for designers and engineers alike.

                      <p>Once identifying each component’s importance and difficulty while also creating a flow for our build process, we needed one final step before 
                        building. We needed to discover which components were dependent on others. Since a component like a data table may require buttons, checkboxes, links, 
                        tooltips, etc, it is certainly not the best place to start.  By organizing our components by dependency, we can do our best to mitigate builds that 
                        are too ahead of their child components in an atomized building process.

                        <p>First starting with research, I would dig deep into both the material/material UI documentation and other design systems to identify both positive 
                          and negative experiences in the design decisions made that would reflect in our products from the audit performed earlier. After collecting notes on 
                          topics such as definition, principles, anatomy, themes, states, behavior, do’s and don’ts as well as an early property table for engineers, I would 
                          go through a review session with a small group to assess questions, comments or concerns about the component.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Once this process was complete, I would begin the early design process on paper and bring the designs to Sketch.  In a design critique session, I 
                          would get additional feedback and begin the Sketch build upon coming to some key design decisions with other designers and engineers.

                        <p>From here, I begin building the component in Sketch to align with the feedback and critique I received from the design session.  This includes 
                          Sketch overrides, color styles, states, etc. Using modern Sketch features like auto sizing and scaling, we can create a flexible component that 
                          will never need to be detached and prevent further issues down the line for our products going out of sync with component updates.
                        </p>

                          <p style="color: white;">Once the build is complete and QA’d visually by the team, we begin the handoff. I will prepare a handoff 
                            document with different states and CSS styles to assist in values that Abstract doesn’t support in our handoff. </p>
                          <p style="color: white;">Since the component is done and approved by the design QA, it is time to get assets together and collect 
                            early research once again to write the documentation. This can include do’s and don’ts, anatomy, principles, definitions, animation, 
                            the API and storybook link.  This is the rulebook for the component to guide our design team if they have questions. We used ReadMe 
                            as a tool to build early documentation and avoid putting too many resources to a custom site.</p>
                          <p style="color: white;">While imagery is being added to the documentation, the component is being engineered and QA’d visually and 
                            functionally by two separate teams. Upon passing both QAs, code samples are updated in Storybook and embedded into our documentation.</p>

                              Once the work is complete, we merge our design and code at the same time to their respective repo to therefore prevent designers from 
                              using a component before it is coded and vice versa. We then update our changelog and notify our users of a new change in the design 
                              system they can upgrade to! Woo hoo!
