        <p>Gloo Design System is an unnamed project at Gloo to help drive context and consistency 
          across all of our products.  Building a design system is a very deliberate process that I 
          have had experience in the past with <a href="/pages/OrchidDS.html" style="color:#41B768" target="_blank">Orchid</a>, and took a deeper leadership role in the 
          decision making process that was to build Gloo Design System.  As of late September 2020, 
          the project has been on hold during a corporate restructure, and should resume in the near future.

          build process of our snackbar and uncover from the inception of the project to the build of the Snackbar 
          the decisions we made to get to this point.  Building the snackbar component was a part of our second proof 
          of concept to prove our process worked before jumping into our component backlog.</p>

          <p>Contrary to what my portfolio may show, I don’t believe every company needs a design system. In fact it has 
            somewhat lost the grandeur of a design system once companies that are notoriously not design forward began 
            appropriating the word as a way to build a component library.  However, at Gloo this was not the case.
          </p>
          <p>At Gloo, there was approximately 8+ products upon joining the team, and the only central alignment of components, 
            primitives and other design decisions were all hosted in a style sheet that was well organized, but lacked anything 
            outside of being a central host of design decisions that may or may not have had reasoning behind the assets provided 
            to designers.  Designers ultimately pulled designs from other products and eventually each product became a patchwork 
            of other products with a lack of UX research behind the design of each component.
          </p>
          <p>I was hired by leadership to bring to the design team a well organized design system that carries over to the engineering 
            team as a tool that will eventually be public facing for third-party designers and engineers.</p>

            <p style="color: white;">I worked closely with leadership to take on some early project management and lead our efforts in

              how critical they are to the early process and what role they will play.  This process helped us streamline meetings and 
              know who needs to be involved where in the process.</p>

                In the design ops space, designs for your fellow co-designers and engineers is really engaging, fun and easy to get 
                feedback.  We want to create an experience and product that empowers our designers to focus on deeper problems than 
                “what color should I use” and help improve the speed and consistency of our code with the help of Gloo’s engineers.

                  <p>Upon coming to the conclusion of the places we need to improve the product in the user flow, I began diving deep into ideation 
                    of certain problems including our content in the card, the scroll interface, the filter ability, error messages and empty state.  
                    Individually attacking each usability problem, we pushed an A/B test virtually and got back results from users during certain tasks 
                    performed.  Many showed an improvement, but my favorite results were polarizing results that varied across the board. It was an 
                    invitation to pivot our thoughts in that part of the design and recreate new designs.

                    <p>However, we also know not every search result returns a result.  However, different users have different options to take based 
                      on their medical plan status. For instance Medicaid members may not have the same resources as commercial members, and we needed 
                      to design each of these pages to ensure we were correct in our design handoffs for engineers. While not the most important step, 
                      we wanted to ensure the handoff was as streamlined as possible for engineers.

                        every project I am on, this product was seeing massive changes that were all validated by users and need to be as close as possible to 
                        the prototypes we tested with users.</p>

                      <p>While we had accomplished shipping a product that was better tested and met the metrics we set early on, there were a few notes we left the 
                        product owner for the upcoming work to be done on the product. Our SUS score increased from a D score of 56 when I joined to a B score of 75 
                        upon finishing these updates.  We also saw NPS increase from 32% to 52% and filter usage increase from 3% to 24%. Upon viewing these results, 
                        we knew that we still had room to improve, but found success in our member market by empowering them with a better experience. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, we also knew there were some additional product design tasks to tackle next. First, there was more research needed to be done on language.  
                        We want to use words that are easily understood, but also understand that insurance is a confusing and regulated industry.  We also worked on other 
                        features in the results cards that we currently did not have in our dataset we gathered everything from. With these in mind, we began the next 
                        journey attacking these hard pressed topics.
