    <p>Valet is an app design I am working on that is a parking solutions app for the public. From early stages to logo design, Valet was a barebones challenge to redesign what never existed in the first place. The design is an attempt at minimalist and flat design to maximize usability without providing a three dimensional hierarchy.</p>
    <p>While this project encompasses my design, UI/UX skill and product design knowledge, it also is a direct representation of my business plan I wrote.  That document is confidential and available only on request, I encourage you to see what I have made and the current steps I have taken to design Valet.</p>
    <h2>Resources Used:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
      <li>Adobe XD</li>
      <li>UI/UX Design</li>
      <li>A/B Testing</li>
    </ul>

      <h1 class="main-head">Early <br><span style="color: white;">Sketches</span>.</h1>
      <a href="./img/Valet-sketch.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./img/Valet-sketch.jpg" id="ValetSketch"></a>
      
      <p>Once talking to a general demographic that would use Valet, we had to know what features they liked and what design layout was preferred.  Taking influence from Uber’s map API on the front page of their app, Valet took this inspiration as a way for someone to quickly search for a spot, regardless of the time.</p>
      <p>Along with the map design, Valet had to acknowledge it had truly two customers: people looking for parking and people looking to share their driveway space. With more than one primary user, Valet must create a design that meets both of their needs in one location.  While these sketches are rudimentary for low-fidelity mock-ups, some could not showcase features such as listing your space or selecting a proper price, but all have been accounted for in the business plan.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="main-head">Branding <br><span style="color: #d64e4e;">Valet</span>.</h1>
      <a href="./img/Valet-logodesign.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./img/Valet-logodesign.jpg" id="ValetLogo"></a>
      
      <p>Developing a brand and an image is sometimes outside the realm of a UI/UX specialist, but I took my graphic design knowledge to begin working on designs for Valet’s logo and many iterations as well as color schemes.  This process was extensive and took to user testing to better understand user’s preferences and readability.  Early designs adopted a more abstract, custom approach, where later designs were much more polished, easier to read and better implemented in electronic format.</p>
      <p>While logo design is merely a ripple in the pond, it helps give the brand a face and color scheme. Ultimately Valet Red and Eggshell White are the defining colors of the brand.  These colors exemplify an automotive brand (IE: Ferrari, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Toyota, etc.) and also a refined off-white to compliment any other deciding colors like dark grey or complimentary colors of the Valet Red.</p>
      <p>The color choice and design also should represent the app design as a whole.  A flat, bright-colored logo would not work well with a monochrome, 3D user interface, and therefore the logo must work well with the UI design. With the current iteration of the Valet design, it exemplifies a well-polished, flat, angular design.  These designs are popular in <script type="text/javascript">document.write(new Date().getFullYear());</script> and should hold up for years to come.</p>

      <h1 class="main-head">Making the<br><span style="color: #d64e4e;">Mockups</span>.</h1>
      <a href="./img/ValetShowcase.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./img/ValetShowcase.jpg" id="valetShowcase"></a>

      
      <p>Along with developing the brand, I wanted to make some high-fidelity mockups, some more responsive and interactive than others.  Early designs strayed from the large map design on the home page, while others focused on interaction immediately.  The final design (seen at the top of the page) was the design that best resonated with my test groups during A/B tests.</p>

      <p>This project was also my first introduction into Adobe XD, and while I had used UI design software in the past such as Axure and Sketch, Adobe XD lacked a few features I wanted upon its initial release.  To this day, while Adobe XD is perfectly fine for mock-ups, it lacks the customizability in programs such as Axure, but focuses more on polishing design for web/app development.</p>  

      <p>Other changes to the software may very well occur over time seeing that visual trends come and go, but as for now, the Valet app design appears to still work well with test users.</p>

      <h1 class="main-head">Project<br><span style="color: #d64e4e;">Continued</span>.</h1>
      <p>While this project encompassed much more design and less programming than my Freedom Transit project, it helped me understand taking a product from absolutely nothing and designing a brand.  More focused on product design and UI design, I was given no limits in this project and am glad I embarked on this journey.</p>
      <p>This project also infused my love for entrepreneurial ventures and software design to make a thoughtful human computer interaction.  It included a 70+ page business plan, a lean-startup plan, a risk management plan, a financial breakdown, a timeline and much more regarding marketing, developing and salaries.  While it may not come to fruition now, I hope to see it do so in the upcoming years with fellow coders, friends, family and the community.</p>
